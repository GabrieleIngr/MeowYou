# MeowYou
This project is a funny cat dating app that I made to practice my front-end skills, Javascript async and object oriented programming. The design and idea is entirely mine. 
You can check this project at the following link: https://meowyou.netlify.app/ . 
If you wish to run it locally you will need to install node.js on your machine, run npm install, get an API key from https://thecatapi.com/ 
and set it up in the project, finally you can launch it with the command "npx netlify dev". 

Have fun!
